# Benchmark of streaming recovery techniques in time series

- **Paper**: Mourad Khayati, Ines Arous, Zakhar Tymchenko and Philippe CudrÃ©-Mauroux: *ORBITS: Online Recovery of Missing Values in Multiple Time Series Streams*. Under review in VLDB 2021.
- **Algorithms**: The full benchmark contains 14 recovery algorithms (all but 2 are rewritten in C++). By default, only the 7 most relevant online algorithms will be evaluated: ORBITS, SPIRIT, GROUSE, OGDImpute, pcaMME, TKCM and M-RNN. To enable any additional algorithm, please refer to the *Algorithms customization* section below.
- **Datasets**: The full benchmark contains 10 different datasets. By default, only the 3 most relevant datasets will be evaluated: gas, motion and bafu. To enable soccer (or any additional dataset), please refer to the *Datasets customization* section below.
- **Scenarios**: The benchmark will execute the full set of 15 different recovery scenarios and generate all the corresponding plots (batch and streaming).
 
## Prerequisites and dependencies (Linux)

- Ubuntu 16 or 18 (including Ubuntu derivatives, e.g., Xubuntu).
- Clone this repository.
- Mono: Install mono from https://www.mono-project.com/download/stable/ and restart the terminal window.

## Build

- Build all the algorithms and Testing Framework using the installation script located in the root folder (takes ~ 1min):
```bash
    $ sh install_linux.sh
```

## Execution


```bash
    $ cd TestingFramework/bin/Debug/
    $ mono TestingFramework.exe 
```

- The full test suite with the default setup will take a sizeable amount of time to run (up to 2 days depending on the hardware) and will produce up to 3GB of output files with all recovered data and plots. 

## Benchmark customization (Optional)

### Algorithms customization

To include/exclude an existing algorithm in/from the benchmark
- open the file `TestingFramework/config.cfg`
- update the line `IgnoreAlgorithms =` with the list of algorithms to exclude

### Datasets customization

- To include an existing dataset (from `TestingFramework/bin/Debug/data/`)
  - open the file `TestingFramework/config.cfg`
  - Add the name of dataset to the line `Datasets =`

- To add your own dataset to the benchmark
  - import the file to `TestingFramework/bin/Debug/data/{name}/{name}_normal.txt` (`name` is the name of your data).
  - Requirements: rows>= 1'000; columns>= 10; column separator = space; row separator = newline

## Prerequisites and dependencies (macOS) 

- The benchmark runs also on macOS, but takes much longer than Linux. 
- macOS 10.13 or higher, homebrew
- Clone the current repository
```bash
    $ xcode-select --install
    $ git clone https://github.com/eXascaleInfolab/bench-incd.git
```
- Mono: Install mono from https://www.mono-project.com/download/stable/ and restart the terminal window.

- If you are running macOS 10.14, you need to install C/C++ headers using the following command:
```bash
    $ open /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/Packages/macOS_SDK_headers_for_macOS_10.14.pkg
```

## Build 

- Build all the algorithms and Testing Framework using the installation script located in the root folder:
```bash
    $ sh install_mac.sh
```
## Execution

```bash
    $ cd TestingFramework/bin/Debug/
    $ mono TestingFramework.exe
```

## Benchmark customization

The algorithm and dataset customization is identical to Linux (see above).

# InCD_benchmark

#### Repository structure
- Algorithms - missing value recovery algorithms: ORBITS (incd), TKCM, SPIRIT, GROUSE, OGDImpute, SSA, M-RNN, pcaMME.
- Datasets - different datasets and time series from different sources.
- Testing Framework - a program to run automated suite of tests on the datasets with the algorithms mentioned above.

### Prerequisites and dependencies (Linux)

- Ubuntu 16 and higher (or Ubuntu derivatives like Xubuntu)
- Sudo rights on the user
- Clone the repository
```bash
    $ git clone https://github.com/eXascaleInfolab/InCD_bench-19.git
```
- Mono Runtime and Compiler: follow step 1 from the installation guide in https://www.mono-project.com/download/stable/ for your Ubuntu version and afterwards do:
```bash
    $ sudo apt-get install mono-devel
```
- All other prerequisites will be installed using a build script.

#### Build & tests

- Restart the terminal window after all the dependencies are installed. Open it in the root folder of the repository.
- Build all the algorithms and Testing Framework using a script in the root folder (takes up to 5 minutes depending which prerequisites are already installed in the system):
```bash
    $ sh install_linux.sh
```
- Run the benchmark:
```bash
    $ cd TestingFramework/bin/Debug/
    $ mono TestingFramework.exe
```
- Test suite will go over datasets one by one and executes all the scenarios for them with both precision test and runtime test. Plots folder in the root of the repository will be populated with the results.
- Remark: full test suite with the default setup will take a sizeable amount of time to run (around 1 day depending on the hardware) and will produce up to 3GB of output files with all recovered data and plots unless stopped early.

#### Customize datasets

To add a dataset to the benchmark
- import the file to `TestingFramework/bin/Debug/data/{name}/{name}_normal.txt`
- - Requirements: >= 10 columns, >= 1'000 rows, column separator - empty space, row separator - newline
- add `{name}` to the list of datasets in `TestingFramework/config.cfg`

#### Customize algorithms

To exclude an algorithm from the benchmark
- open the file `TestingFramework/config.cfg`
- add an entry `IgnoreAlgorithms =` and specify the list of algorithm codes to exclude them
- the line starting with `IgnoreAlgorithms =` provides codes for all the algorithms in the benchmark
